While there are still a small number of speakers that haven't confirmed , we have already published our schedule for the 2024 edition.
We have a variety of content lined up for you ranging from our traditional long trusted infrastructure as code tools all the way to extremely new and fresh off the press 
new tools , discussing automating everything from Mainframe  , Bare Metal, Private (or local)  and Public  Cloud  to containers and other resources. 

As always, registration is free but required for crowd control. 

Looking forward to see you all in Gent in a couple of weeks !
