In case you aren't following us on Twitter and and haven't noticed.
Our CFP has been open for a while now


Weâ€™re pleased to announce CfgMgmtCamp 2019, the sixth year and 8th edition. CfgMgmtCamp has evolved beyond pure configuration management, so we are evolving the topics and content of the conference. CfgMgmtCamp wants to bring all infrastructure management tools and principles together to share and learn.


While there is still almost a month left to submit your talks  don't wait to long ;)
