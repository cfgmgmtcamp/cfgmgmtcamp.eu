In Puppet 6, we removed several core types and providers into modules, and published most of those onto the Puppet Forge.  
This talk covers the history and motivation behind removing them, hurdles we faced, module authorship with PDK, setting up CI pipelines,
and the behind the scenes view of how the extracted modules are repackaged back into Puppet agent.
