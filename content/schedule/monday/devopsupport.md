As DevOps practices and modern software defined infrastructure become increasingly established in enterprises,
and as the scale of delivery grows, practitioners increasingly find themselves drawn into traditional IT support structures.  
Here, they find themselves expected to act as part of a classic multi-tier support structure,
with at least part of their time spent acting as a 3rd line support function.  

This presentation explores the problems this creates:
its siloed nature creates inefficient work-in-progress queues,
and reduces cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing.  

Service Management plays a vital role in managing system consumers at scale,
but it needs to modernise to work well in the new era.  
Hence, this presentation explores emergent methods such as Swarming,
and new thinking such as Cynefin, which bring new thinking and new structures which align much better to modern development and operations thinking.
