This talk will show a uncommon case study for Foreman at NETWAYS.  
Our training schedule is fully packed with public and in-house training courses and
having many different topics requires us to change training environments quite often and
in short time to get them to different locations.  
Moving away from golden images to Foreman and Puppet has enabled our Events team to provision training environments independently from technical stuff.  
The Discovery Plugin allows to use the same process for handling rental notebooks for in-house training courses and big conference.  
Virtual machines for the training labs have gone from manual provisioning through managed by Foreman to Vagrant to get even more flexibility.  
And the latest step to reduce the need for re-provisioning is by using LVM snapshots and downloading Virtual Machine images from the cloud.
