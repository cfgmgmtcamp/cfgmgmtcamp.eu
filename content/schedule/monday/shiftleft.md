In the agile, lean, devops communities people talk about improving security by "shifting left".  
Patterns and tools are emerging, or re-emerging,
that make security less of a pain in the development process while also making applications more secure.  
I will cover tools and processes that help teams with the day to day work like
code scanners, application scanners, pull requests, deployment tooling and infrastructure-as-code.  
At the organisational level some relatively small changes to, for instance, the change approval process can have a big impact.  
These are tools and processes that have proven themselves at many organisations and perhaps they can do the same for you.
