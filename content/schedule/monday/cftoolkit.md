The CFEngine team has been working on various scripts and tooling to make it easier to
deploy, upgrade, test, and troubleshoot CFEngine installations.
In this talk, we will focus on 4 new tools; cf-net (introduced in 3.10),
cf-check (introduced in 3.12.1), cf-remote, and cf-policyupgrade (under development).  
Some technical details will be covered,
but most of the discussion will be centered around use cases and functionality.
All tools covered are free and open source, written in C and Python 3.  

The speakers are developers on the CFEngine team.  
We will encourage the audience to ask questions, give feedback and suggestions during and after the presentation.
