Choria is a 2 year old project that started life as an easy route to using MCollective for open source Puppet users.  
It has evolved to encompass a number of technologies related to large scale systems management
and have been deployed on globe spanning sites with 100s of thousands of nodes and thousands of daily active users.  


This talk will give an update on the projects status, progress, and will explore some of the new technologies created in this project.  


With the arrival of Puppet 6 in fall 2018 Puppet Inc has officially deprecated The Marionette Collective and
have donated the legacy MCollective code bases to the Choria project.  
We will explore what options Puppet 6 users have for benefiting from their past investments in the MCollective platform and
look at work done that will be of particular interest to Puppet users such as orchestrating nodes using the Puppet DSL using Choria Playbooks.
