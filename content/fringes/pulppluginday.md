Pulp is a platform for managing repositories of software packages, but it can store any kind of
binary data (e.g. cat photos). The core provides a REST API and manages files, but the real value
for users is delivered by the plugins which allow core to manage a content type like a cat photo.

Please join some of the Pulp developers on February 6th for Pulp Plugin Day. This will be an
opportunity to add new features to any of the
[existing plugins](https://pulpproject.org/pulp-3-plugins/) or start on a new plugin to support
another content type.

We are going to start at 10 am by going over the
[Plugin Writer's Guide](https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/plugins/index.html#plugin-writer-s-guide).
Then everyone is going to setup a development environment and start working on a Pulp plugin of
their choice.
