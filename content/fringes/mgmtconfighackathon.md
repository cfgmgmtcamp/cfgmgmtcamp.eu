[Mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/) is a real-time automation tool that
is fast and safe. The [main author](https://twitter.com/purpleidea) will be on
site to chat with you about mgmt, review your code, help you get your patch
merged and listen to your design ideas for the project!

Come to get help implementing your first mgmt resource, write a new language
function, or even get help writing your very first module! We'll also discuss
and explain any internals that anyone is curious about.

You're also welcome to drop in if you'd like to see any of the mgmt demos from
the conference. Don't be shy, newcomers welcome! A tentative schedule has been
proposed, but we'll modify this as needed.

| time | topic |
|---|---|
|10:00 | Welcome: General questions / Discussion |
|10:30 | Quick Start: Building and running from source |
|11:30 | Function/Resource API: Writing a custom function or resource |
|13:30 | Modules: Writing a new module |
|14:30 | Open hacking and other topics |

We'll be giving quick 15 min intro sessions about those topics starting at those
times, and then open hacking and questions up until the next 15 minute session
starts. Come hack with us all day :) Stickers will be provided to participants!

because I made it before I knew we could use the first one and it's pretty. This
is all free, and it helps us guage interest and plan accordingly!
