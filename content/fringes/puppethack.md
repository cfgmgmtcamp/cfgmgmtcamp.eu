Please join us on 6th Feb after Config Management Camp for a free #puppethack day. 

\#puppethack is a collaborative, relaxed community hack day. It's an opportunity for Puppet community and staff to 
collaborate on fun and interesting Puppet-related projects. Fixing on modules, core Puppet code, testing, and related 
projects.

Please remember to [register](https://registration.cfgmgmtcamp.be/ghent/2019/) through the general Config Management Camp registration system.

Don't forget that #puppethack, like all Puppet Community participation, falls under our community guidelines, which also 
contain helpful tips for using IRC, our bug tracker, and other relevant tools.
