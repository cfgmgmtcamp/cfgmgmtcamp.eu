Felix has been running distributed systems since 2004 and likes using and tinkering with various automation tools.  
Special interests have included Puppet, Ansible, and mgmt.  

He very occasionally updates a blog, and otherwise tries to get enough exercise to wind down from his day job running Hadoop clusters for The unbelievable Machine Company.
