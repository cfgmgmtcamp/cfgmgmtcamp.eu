Situations arise like log files filling up disks, failed login attempts that could be brute force attacks, and unwanted processes and services running.
Using the Beacon system of SaltStack, we can monitor a system for these &amp;amp; other scenarios.
Pairing this with the Reactor system, we can have SaltStack remediate those systems to the desired state.</description></item><item><title>CFToolkit - New tooling in CFEngine 3.10, 3.12, and beyond</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/cftoolkit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/cftoolkit/</guid><description>The CFEngine team has been working on various scripts and tooling to make it easier to deploy, upgrade, test, and troubleshoot CFEngine installations.

Martin, in the early 2000s.
These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily re-factor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.
This talk discusses our options how we can model puppet code while applying the SOLID principles.</description></item><item><title>Break</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/breakafternoon0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:00:00

Some have called SRE &amp;lsquo;DevOps 2.0&amp;rsquo;, while others view it as a competing standard.

Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it make sense to bring a community driven approach to operational code itself?
This talk is about bringing those ideas together, to create effective open source communities for operational code on Kubernetes and on traditional machine or cloud environments.
Collaborating on complex infrastructure, and using open source to share the benefits of that collaboration, will enable us all to spend more time focused on the things which are truly different about our challenges and less on the problems we all share.</description></item><item><title>Istio: Control and Observability for

Terraform, Helm, Compose, CloudFormation, Pulumi, ARM templates, etc. No one tool solves all your needs.
And new tools come along regularly. But all tools tend to invent there own packaging.
In this talk we&amp;rsquo;ll introduce the Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB) specification, and some associated tooling.
CNAB embraces the multi-tool world and allows for packaging up multiple formats and their accompanying toolchains into a single artefact.</description></item><item><title>Foreman Construction Day Pre-Noon</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/foreman0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/foreman0/</guid><description/></item><item><title>MgmtCamp After-Noon Hackathon</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/mgmtcamp1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/mgmtcamp1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>MgmtCamp Pre-Noon Hackathon</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/mgmtcamp0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/mgmtcamp0/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Observabilty at scale</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/observescale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/observescale/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ole Herman Elgesem</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/speaker/olehermanelgesem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/speaker/olehermanelgesem/</guid><description>C and Python developer for CFEngine / Northern.tech.
