DESCRIPTION:"In the era of containers and other dynamic platforms, management of entry points is becoming a great challenge,with the large amounts of application deployments requiring entry points to update often.  And the patterns for routing, blue / green or canary, are challenging to scale.  You want secured HTTPS requests on your applications, while ensuring certificates are up to date on these ephemeral URLs,thus requiring a lot of plumbing.  Learn how to overcome this complexity, and successfully build reliable entry points, focusing your energy on what matters to you.  Our session will define what a modern edge router, reverse proxy and load-balancer are, from Traefik;s point of view.  We will then present concepts and advanced features which overcome the platform entry point challenges.  And finally, we'll dig deeper and show how we can scale these solutions and make them fault tolerant.  We look forward to the Q & A section and chatting those who have questions around dynamic configuration,Ingress Controllers and with those who wish to learn how Traefik helps developers build the best infrastructure with ease.

SUMMARY:CNAB: packaging for distributed applications with multiple toolchains
ORGANIZER:Gareth Rushgrove

DESCRIPTION:"When you're managing distrubyted applications you're probably using a variety of tools that serve specific purposes.  Terraform, Helm, Compose, CloudFormation, Pulumi, ARM templates, etc. No one tool solves all your needs.  And new tools come along regularly. But all tools tend to invent there own packaging.  In this talk we'll introduce the Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB) specification, and some associated tooling.  CNAB embraces the multi-tool world and allows for packaging up multiple formats and their accompanying toolchains into a single artefact.  Imagine a single installable package that contains Terraform code to launch an RDS instance and a Compose file orHelm charts describing the application that will use it.  Today you might package and distribute those separately, with CNAB you can keep them together.  That means we can share metadata, cryptographically sign a single artefact, push all aspects of the application to a central registry and more.  In this talk we'll introduce CNAB, discuss some of the problems it solves, and show demos of the accompanying tooling.  "

DESCRIPTION:"Benefits fueled by the modularity of the pulp plugin ecosystem by taking the example of pulp_deb and pulp_gem.  Pulp is a rest-api driven, plugin based framework for content repository management.  Despite being used unmediated, it is also employed as a key backend component in foreman/katello.  Its complete rewrite, needing a reimplementation of all content plugins, invites for experimentation with new technologies.  In this talk we introduce the new version of one of those plugins for debian packages, with its unique challenges.  Also we compare with a completely new one for rubygems.  "

DESCRIPTION:"Choria is a 2 year old project that started life as an easy route to using MCollective for open source Puppet users.  It has evolved to encompass a number of technologies related to large scale systems managementand have been deployed on globe spanning sites with 100s of thousands of nodes and thousands of daily active users.  This talk will give an update on the projects status, progress, and will explore some of the new technologies created in this project.  With the arrival of Puppet 6 in fall 2018 Puppet Inc has officially deprecated The Marionette Collective andhave donated the legacy MCollective code bases to the Choria project.  We will explore what options Puppet 6 users have for benefiting from their past investments in the MCollective platform andlook at work done that will be of particular interest to Puppet users such as orchestrating nodes using the Puppet DSL using Choria Playbooks.

This talk introduces two practical ways to define and provision complex applications using Ansible Automation with Kubernetes.    The Automation Broker allows users to leverage Ansible Automation to define and orchestrate applications,making them available for self-service provisioning in the Service Catalog.    The Ansible Operator allows users to actively manage the full lifecycle of an application by defining management behaviors with Ansible;the Operator handles everything else.  In this session you will learn:- How to define and deploy your application on Kubernetes using Ansible.- How to publish your own applications in the Kubernetes Service Catalog.- How to create a Kubernetes Operator using Ansible."

DESCRIPTION:"So, there is case, every once in a few days the kafka cluster dies andalong dies the whole application resulting in revenue loss for the company.   Starting there, I would like to describe how we approached the unknown issue, assumptions, failure, trial and error,until we found the root cause: a known bug in the respective version of the famous distributed software.  Of course, every software has bugs and hitting a major one is not such uncommon but more than that,what is actually important is the actual lessons learnt during the process:- how do we monitor our infrastructure and ways to improve it- what actually happens inside our application, how do failures of external software affect it, how we can improve stability- tools we have Vs tools we need, call for more automation- what are the actual resources we need for our use case, if we under/overprovision, understand our scale and optimize the costs- importance of documentation and post-mortems, the 5 WHYs.Major takeaway of this talk: tackle your incidents as a way to understand more about your systems(both technical systems: infra, code, tools AND non-technical systems: teams, workflows, procedures, practices) and design them better.

DESCRIPTION:"This talk will show a uncommon case study for Foreman at NETWAYS.  Our training schedule is fully packed with public and in-house training courses andhaving many different topics requires us to change training environments quite often andin short time to get them to different locations.  Moving away from golden images to Foreman and Puppet has enabled our Events team to provision training environments independently from technical stuff.  The Discovery Plugin allows to use the same process for handling rental notebooks for in-house training courses and big conference.  Virtual machines for the training labs have gone from manual provisioning through managed by Foreman to Vagrant to get even more flexibility.  And the latest step to reduce the need for re-provisioning is by using LVM snapshots and downloading Virtual Machine images from the cloud.  "

DESCRIPTION:"Kubernetes with Kubevirt is the uprising solution for unified management of virtual machines and containers.  Foreman is well known as a complete life cycle systems management tool for provisioning, configuring and monitoring of physical and virtual servers.  The talk will focus on the newly added support for Kubevirt in Foreman which allows provisioning and configuration of Virtual Servers on top of Kubernetes with Kubevirt.  After describing the use-cases and the supported functionality provided by the integration, I intend to show a demo that combines all of the pieces and the interaction between them.  The demo will show how a virtual server is being created from Foreman, adding a VM on KubeVirt compute resource and provision its OS from PXE.  The setup is a bit complex due to the nature of the moving parts and those will be explained as well prior to the demo.  "

With mgmt's support for Puppet code, migrating becomes a lot more natural.  This session does a deep dive and shows how mgmt will allow you to use and maintain a mixed code base of both Puppet's and mgmt's DSLs.  "

Security compliance is a state where computer systems are scrutinized against certain defined security policy.  OpenSCAP is one such security compliance ecosystem that provides multiple tools to assist administrators and auditorswith assessment, measurement, and enforcement of security baselines.  Foreman provides OpenSCAP as a plugin that enables Foreman to receive automated vulnerability assessment andsecurity compliance audits from Foreman hosts. You can upload SCAP compliance contents,create compliance policies out of them and further, these policies can be assigned to various hosts or hostgroups created through foreman.  OpenSCAP reports will help users find vulnerabilities on the hosts and also suggest remediation plan to fix those vulnerabilities.  Foreman OpenSCAP plugin is made of 4 components viz., foreman_openscap, smart_proxy_openscap, foreman_scap_client and puppet-foreman_scap_client.  These components together establish the Foreman and OpenSCAP integration.  "

They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily re-factor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.

This talk is about bringing those ideas together,to create effective open source communities for operational code on Kubernetes and on traditional machine or cloud environments.  Collaborating on complex infrastructure, and using open source to share the benefits of that collaboration,will enable us all to spend more time focused on the things which are truly different about our challenges and less on the problems we all share.

Areas covered:- basic streaming overview- design of the global network- design of a replication tool particular to the needs- building hierarchical cached views of the estate- exposing data to other systems with examples- using stream processing methodologies to perform real time analysis and remediation of the fleetWe;ll also explore how this is a good parallel for IoT where the mentioned node scale is considered small.  While this talk demonstrates a platform built using specific technologies and the design of those will influence the talk,it's not a vendor talk and we’ll make efforts so the ideas are transferred and not the glossies from any one tool.

DESCRIPTION:"Unikernels are a new class of operating system.  The core idea is to merge the kernel, libraries, and application into a single image binary, operating in a single address space.  This has the potential to improve security, performance, and a few other factors.  For native Unikernel applications, this moves configuration to the build stage.  So how are we supposed to manage these applications?  How should they be configured and deployed?  How can we profile them?  Debug them?   The talk will start with what a Unikernel is, an overview of the Unikernel landscape and their different characterist.  Where are they heading?  An interesting development is happening with Unikernels sneaking their way onto Linux systems and playing hand-in-hand with more traditional systems.  I'll demo a couple of Unikernel applications.  Show how they are configured and deployed.  What tools exist and what tools are missing.  A bit of talk about the joys and pains of deploying an untested class of operating systems in production.  Open questions for which I have no answers but will solicit feedback are:- What existing tools could be used to manage this class of applications?- What class of problems matches the characteristics of Unikernels (Real-time, immutable, small)"

DESCRIPTION:"To borrow a phrase, "In the beginning was the command line." Then we had ISConf and CFEngine, and things were good... for a while.  Puppet and Chef came along, embodying the idea that infrastructure code should behave like application code.  More recently, Ansible brought the concept of idempotent resources to imperative workflows, but stops short of modelling in favor of radical simplicity.  Now we're wondering: is it possible to get the best of both worlds?  Can we get model-based guarantees plus orchestrated action?  I think the answer is "yes" and in this talk I will explore an emerging "fourth generation" of config management tools that attempt to bring the beneficial properties of models together with orchestrated action. In full disclosure, I'll talk about Puppet's Bolt and Lyra projects, but the talk will not be vendor-specific as tools like Terraform and OpsMop also exemplify this approach."

Many teams have already sailed past an event horizon of complexity and found that their old tools and processes no longer work for them.  But why, exactly?  What was wrong with traditional metrics and logs?  Why are they failing to keep pace with modern requirements?  Isn't observability just a marketing term for monitoring? And what on earth can we do about it?  In this talk we'll cover the shortcomings of traditional metrics and logs,and the technical and cultural differences between monitoring and observability.  We'll also talk about the deep cultural revolution underway from siloed specialtiestowards software ownership (in every type of engineering role) --and what exactly does that mean when it comes to systems observability? -- as well as the technical practices and mental shifts that are absolutely required to keep pace with modern infrastructure.
